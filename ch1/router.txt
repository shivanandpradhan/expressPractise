    Router 

        It is used to create modulear, mountable route handlers.
        A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system.
        
    steps:

        create router Module :
            routes/student.js
        
        create router instance 
            const router = express.Router()
        
        define routes using router object.
            router.get("/", (req, res) => {
                res.send("home Page");
            })
        
        export router
            export default router;
            or 
            module.exports = router;
        
        open app.js

        import router module
            import router from "routes/router.js"
            or 
            const router = require("./routes/student.js");
        
        load router module.
            app.use(router)
                move to the router and execute on the basis of valid path.

            app.use('url', router)
                new path will be "url/..." 
                ... denotes routes defined in router.

    route parameters
        these are named url segments that are used to capture the values specified
        at their position in the URL.
        
        these values are populated in the req.params object, with the name 
        of the route parameter specified in the path.

            eg. 
                /student/:id 
                /student/:category/:id
                /product/order/:year/and/:month
                /train/:from-:to
            
        route parameter with regex
            we can append a regular expression in parenthesis (())
                /student/:id([0-9]{2}) // www.examle.com/student/12  i.e only 2 digit number.
                /student/:name([a-z]) // www.example.com/student/anamika
            - choices.. 
                /:type(post|article)/:id   //  /post/12   /article/22
        
        route parameter 

            app.param() :- 

                - This function is used to add the callback triggers to route parameters. 
                  It is commonly used to check for the existence of the data requested 
                    related to the route parameter.
                
                - all param callbacks will be called before any handler of any route
                     in which the param occurs.
                    
                - syntax :
                    app.param(name, callback)
                    app.param([name1, name2, name3, ....], callback)

                    if name is an array, then callback trigger is registered for each parameters in the order,  
                    that they are declared.

                - example :
                    app.param("id", (req, res, next, id) => {
                        console.log(`id : ${id}`);
                    })
        
    query string
        /student?id=12&name=shiva&age=12

        to get query
            req.query
