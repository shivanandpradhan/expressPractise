        - use of express()
            It is a top-level function exported by the express module.
            const app = express()
                app returned by the function is in fact a js function, designed to be passed 
                to Node's http servers as a callback to handle request.

        - defining port and host
            const port = process.env.PORT || "3000"
            const host = "localhost"
        
        - listening on server : listen()
            it binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port.

            If port is ommitted or is 0, then the os will assign an arbitrary unused port 
            which is useful for cases like automated tasks.
