    - Routing :

        It refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a 
        particular endpoint, which is a URi (OR PATH) and  a specific HTTP rquest method (get,post...)

        syntax :
            - app.method(path, callback)
            - app.method(path, [callback1, callback2, callback3, ... ])
            - app.method(path, [callback1, callback2, ...], callback)
        

                - app : instance of express
                - method : http request method, written in lowercase.
                    
                    get : retrieve data
                    post : create/ insert data
                    put : completely update data
                    patch : partially update data
                    delete : delete data
                    all : any http request method
                        all method is useful for mapping "global logic" for specific path prefixes.
                            
                            - app.all("/prev_all", (req, res, next) => {
                                console.log("accessing the secret section ");
                                next();  // calling next callback.
                              })
                            - app.all("/api/*", requireAuthentication);

                - path : path on the server.

                    it can be strigns, string patterns or regular expression. query strings are 
                    not part of route path.

                    chars like ? + * and () are subsets of their reg exp.
                    hypen(-) and dot(.) are interpreted by string based path.
                    for using dollar sign in path. enclose it like([\$])

                        app.get("/data/([\$])book, callback)
                    
                - callback : function executed when the route is matched.
                    function (req, res, next) {}
                
                - chained route callbacks 
                    app.route(path) :- it returns an instance of a single route which you can
                                         use to handle http verbs with optional middlewares. This
                                        method is used to avoid duplicate route names for different methods.
                                    
                                eg :
                                    app.route("/student").get(
                                        (req, res) => {
                                            res.send("get method")
                                        }
                                    ).post(
                                        (req, res) => {
                                            res.send("post method")
                                        }
                                    ).put(
                                        (req, res) => {
                                            res.send("update method")
                                        }
                                    )
