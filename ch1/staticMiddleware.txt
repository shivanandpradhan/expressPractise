9. ch9_static

    css, js, image, video etc files are considered as static files in express js.
    To serve these, use express.static middleware function in express

    syntax :
        
        express.static(root, [options])
    
    Example :

        app.use(express.static('public'))
        http.//localhost:3000/css/styles
    
    To create a virtual path prefix (where path doesnot actually exist in the file system).

        app.use("/static", express.static("public"))
        http.localhost:3000/static/css/style.css
    
    The path that we provide to the express.static() is realative to the directory from where 
    you launch your node process.
    If you run the app from another directory, then it is better to use the absolute path of the 
    directory that you want to serve.

        app.use('/static', express.static(join(process.cwd(), 'public')))
